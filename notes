 Atoms are essentially integer values that are associated with string name
Unique Identifiers: Each atom is associated with a unique string name. "WM_NAME" is an atom that represents the name of a window managed by a window manager.
Global Scope: Atoms are global within a display. Once an atom is created for a string, it can be used by any client connected to that display. This allows different applications to refer to the same property or type consistently.
Common Uses: Atoms are commonly used for:
Window properties (e.g., title, class, type).
Selection mechanisms (e.g., clipboard operations).
Communication between clients and the X server regarding events and protocols.
